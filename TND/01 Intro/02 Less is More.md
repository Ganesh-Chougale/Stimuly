Do not oversature the thumbnail with multiple things  
more things means cliche not more good stuff  

in the thumbnail design lets see that by an example:  
##### Less Vs More:  
![](../z_Images/01/003.png) 
`Left Hand Side Thumbnail`:  
1. Hindi text limiting global audience, like south asia contains india, Pakistan & Bangladesh but hindi text wont be recognized by Pakistani or Bangladeshi audience.  
2. so much congestion in the thumbnail, make it more difficult to digest by just look of it.  

`Right Hand Side Thumbnail`:  
1. English text deos not limits any audience at all, even rural area as literate to read & understand enough the English text but we can have native text if we have only content dedicated to native audience  
2. less but accurate text in the thumbnail  

so moral of the story, `less but accurate & concise is more than arbitrarly more`.
