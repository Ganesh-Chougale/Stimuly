like the promo teaser of chhava, it has nice matalic look to text from left side, VK as Chh. Sambhaji Maharaj taking 40% of right screen, it looks amazing  
we read the thumbnail from left to right so we saw the title & then VK which is perfect example of perfect thumbnail. & indicatation is it got `1.3M` views in just `21hours`  

thumbnail is all about creating curiousity, & this thumbnail nailed it rightly.
